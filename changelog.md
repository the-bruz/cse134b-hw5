## Site Changes

* Remove unnecessary animations and transforms for html elements.
* Add a self-description part to the main page.
* Add styles for the self-description part.
* Add script for the project page, so the user can now switch among different projects to see the different project descriptions, project previews, and project links by clicking the project list in the right.

## 3rd Party Script

* Add google analytics to the pages. With this, I can monitor the data through my webpage, understand how many people are paying attention to my website, and help my site to be found by the search engine.
